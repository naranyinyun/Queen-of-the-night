This project is designed for my literature, so this repository will include two licenses, the code part will use the Unlicense and the text part will use the CC4.0 BY-NC-SA to share content. Actually, I really don't care how my works will be used, just fuck the world and do whatever you want, we are to tired, we just need piece of peace.

If I dead in some days, just remember to let others know I have lived in this world, strongly and sadly live in this fucking world as an common human.

This repository may be proof that I have lived in this world.

I've been living for a day.

Chinese winter is too cold, I nearly can't take it anymore.

世事一场大梦, 人生几度秋凉?  
夜来风叶已鸣廊, 看取眉头鬓上.
